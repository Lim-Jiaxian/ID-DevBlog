            Started learning about web development, how a website is brought together by HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
            HTML, also known as Hypertext Markup Language is to be considered the backbone of a website. While CSS, Cascading Style Sheet works as an aesthetics designer.
            Last but not least, JS which is JavaScript, works as the brain. With all of these combined, website creation is possible! <br><br>The picture above was my 1st creation of website introduced as a CA to be completed in the first week of lesson. Initially, i didn't know what concept of design that should implemented,
            what food to show and the necessary steps to make the website visually more attractive. After much consideration, i decided to create a template first, the interface where my text would be, pictures and background color.
            After some online self-help tips on arranging certain text and image to proper sizes. My first website was live!

            Semantic html css was covered. There are header, nav, article and section. Individually, they all work differently and bring out various results.
            Header are the headers for a website. Nav is navigational buttons / links to different elements in the same existing site. Articles are a small portion of space to
            fill in all the important details and lastly, section is a small portion of space similar to article but made larger for content and topics.<br><br>For my week2-CA, i used the concept of headers, footers, nav and div to separate 
            a website to enable it for a better view with enough white space and arrangments, this way people who are viewing the website will be able to view the different areas easily instead of having all the items being cramped together making it harder to see.

            Media queries and flexbox were introduced. When different devices visit websites, media queries are responsible for alternating and changing some
            viewpoints across the different IT devices, which is setting up min-width and max-width views to keep the website look proportional. Other than that, flexbox are
            also used to adapt the layout to suit contents such as mobile layout that is vertical and desktop layout which is horizontal. In week 3 CA, i devised different skills learnt from
            media queries and flexbox to shape and alter a weebsite containing words and a logo. I was tasked to move the logo on top of a border which contains the text as well as to amend changes to
            the sizes of all objects to fit the screen size.

            Learned about responsive images, basically they will automatically resize the image / picture based on the device's screen. This way, it can process higher resolution images when needed which also provides 
            more efficiency on design control. It can also shifts the text and image to different places other than it's original view. For instance, week4 ca, i'm required to change the view and picture format places 
            differently depending on the screen size. On the desktop view, the image is on the left while the text is placed just right beside it on the right. However, as the screen size shifts, the image will be center positioned while
            the text will be directly below.

            Since week 5 is whitespace week, our lecturers has given us a task to complete online. This includes self-learning tutorial short-courses and creation of the pratices, challenges and tutorials from the video itself. All the materials
            are based of linkedin learning, specifically on JavaScript. This teaches how to use the application, objects, string outputs, DOM (Document Object Model) and Variables as well as Data types. Well i have to admit, learning online & physically 
            is completely different this depends on people. But personally, learning online doesn't really feel the same interactions as if learning physically since we can always pose & ask questions in doubt. But online encourages us to seek solutions 
            from multiple channels, browsers and stackoverflow.<br><br> For this week's CA, it will be the pratices & challenges from the online learning platform. I've created a different new object called game character, in this object it has several properties
            & values, such as the name, the wepon that is equipped, elemental skill, character hair colour and so on. Once completion, I created a constructor based on this object to retrieve it's values. Besides that, I've also learnt query selector that allows 
            users to navigate to different areas on the website via a console. It allows you to make unsave and personal & volatile changes that will be wiped upon refreshing or closing the pages.

            During week 6, our lecturers recapped about what we learnt from JavaScript during whitespace week. This includes 3 primitive datatypes, number values like decimal, intergers and even floating points. Secondly, strings, which is a sequence of alphabetical values to
            store lines of text. Lastly, booleans that represents Logical input / output Data with True or False. Apart from that, there are also 2 other non-primitive data types such as undefined and null. Undefined data variables has no value asigned to it and for null data 
            type equates to a non-existent entity. Template Literals were also mentioned as a method that is used similarly like a place holder, with the use of backtick symbols (`), the code will be represented with more fresher and clean look that is more readable and easy to 
            understand. The differences between literal objects and function-based objects were also recapped, literal objects does not contain any constructors and could not be inherited while function-based objects gas constructors and allows inheritance with the cause of being
            out of scope and messy.<br><br> The CA activity covered this week is more on JavaScript, using the conditions and logical operators to print out various outputs. Looping objects & arrays with while and for loops, creating var and let variables. Creation of constance & 
            functions were also used. I was tasked to create a variable object called momobae and input attributes into it while using console log to display & view the changes made.
